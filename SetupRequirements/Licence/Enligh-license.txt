    In using the Software and/or Managed Service, the Customer shall at all times comply with these Terms and Conditions as well as the terms of the EULA and/or SLA applicable at the time of execution of this agreement. In particular, the Software must not be reproduced, transferred or decompiled (i.e. recompilation into the source code), unless expressly permitted by the EULA or permitted according to law. If the Customer wishes to reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software (hereinafter referred to as "De-compilation") for the purpose of achieving interoperability with other computer programs if allowed by law, the Customer shall contact Vibranium before De-compilation of the Software and request the provision of the information necessary for the achievement of such interoperability. If Vibranium supplies such information concerning interoperability without undue delay, the Customer shall not be entitled to decompile the Software.
    Software for which no special Licenses for Multiple Use are available according to the relevant product information is restricted to use on one Computer by a Customer. For this purpose, the Customer may use any available Computer that meets the system requirements and for which the License was granted. Should the Customer change the Computer, the Software must be deleted from the Computer on which the Software was previously installed before the reinstallation of the Software on a different Computer. For Software whose product information provides special Licenses for Multiple Use, Multiple Use shall be permissible only if, and to the extent that, the Customer purchased and was granted the relevant type or number of Licenses by Vibranium.
    Unless explicitly granted in the applicable License, Customer shall not have the right to access Managed Services by simultaneous or multiple use of the same Login.
    Vibranium reserves all rights to bring an action to prohibit or stop any unauthorized use of Products and/or Services by the Customer, including but not limited to, claims for injunctive relief and damages. Unauthorized use by the Customer may lead to criminal prosecution under the relevant laws. The provisions of this clause 4.7.4. Concerning reproduction and disclosure shall apply similarly for the user handbooks and other documents pertaining to the Software provided by Vibranium. Reference is also made to the supplementary terms and conditions of use under the applicable EULA and/or the SLA.
    Special provisions for Resellers:
        If Products and/or Services are provided to a Reseller, the Reseller may transfer the License to a third party. In the event of a resale, the serial numbers issued by Vibranium (e.g. License numbers, OTCs or Logins) shall be stated in the invoice.
        The Reseller shall not grant to its Customers any rights in the Products and/or Services that are different from, or greater than, those permitted pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, a EULA and/or an SLA.
        The Reseller shall not reproduce the Products and/or Services in whole or in part, including for purposes of data backup.
        The parties acknowledge that damages resulting from a breach of this clause by Reseller are difficult to determine and/or quantify. Therefore, for each breach of the foregoing provisions of this clause 5, and without prejudice to Vibranium right to seek other remedies at law or in equity the Reseller shall pay to Vibranium liquidated damages in the amount of USD 20,000. Additional claims by Vibranium resulting from the breach of these provisions remains unaffected. Such liquidated damages will be set off against any other damage awards to Vibranium resulting from the breach.

8. Delivery

    Vibranium delivery obligations shall be governed only by (i) Vibranium order confirmation, (ii) these Terms, (iii) the EULA and/or the SLA (as applicable) unless explicitly agreed otherwise between the parties in writing. Vibranium may render partial deliveries where a partial delivery is reasonable for the Customer and does not significantly impair the Customer's interests.
    Deviations of the delivered Products and/or Services from documentation shall be permitted provided that they are reasonable and that the performance of the Products or Services is not materially, adversely affected. Vibranium reserves the right to make technical changes to the Products and/or Services which enhance their operability and performance or which are necessary for the operability of the Products and/or Services.
    Should Products and/or Services licensed by Customer be replaced by new Products and/or Services in Vibranium product line, and such new Products and/or Services perform as well or better than the Products and/or Services ordered by Customer, then Vibranium has the right to deliver such new Products and/or Services instead of the ordered Products and/or Services.
    Should Products and/or Services of Vibranium be shipped at the Customer's request, the risk for damage and loss shall pass to the Customer upon release for shipment by Vibranium. In the event of receipt of Software by download, risk shall pass to the Customer as soon as Customer has received the necessary Software Key.
    Should Vibranium performance be delayed beyond the date confirmed by Vibranium, claims for late performance may only be asserted following the expiry of a reasonable grace period of no less than three weeks set by the Customer. Should Vibranium be in default of its delivery obligations or should delivery become impossible for Vibranium , Vibranium shall only be liable pursuant to clauses 10. and 11 below. If timely delivery is prevented by circumstances that are not just temporary and that do not fall within Vibranium control (in particular, in the event of strike, lock-out, unavailability of materials, force majeure, transport hindrances, plant closures or unavailability of internet connection), Vibranium or the Customer may, upon ten (10) days written notice, rescind this agreement without giving rise to any obligation to the other party.
    Automatic renewal

Access to Managed Services is granted for the particular License Term. Unless terminated by either Party at least 30 days prior to the end of the current License Term, the License Term will be renewed for an added License Term, automatically, at the then effective list price. The new License Term will have the same duration as the previous License Term.

9. Remuneration and payment terms

    Unless expressly agreed otherwise, Vibranium Fees are net free place of shipment, and all shipping costs, in particular, packaging, transport costs and transport insurance, as well as applicable statutory value added tax - if any - shall be paid by the Customer.
    Payments shall be due immediately without any deductions. Bills of exchange and checks shall be accepted by Vibranium only pursuant to a special agreement between the parties and only if these methods of payment do not give rise to any costs and fees for Vibranium.
    If the Customer defaults in payments, Vibranium may demand agreed upon or statutory default interest for all past due sums without further notice.
    IF the Customer defaults in payment, then Vibranium may withhold all deliveries to the Customer, including Updates and Upgrades.
    Customer should carefully note the consequences of a failure to install Updates/Upgrades, in particular, that the protective function of the Software may be impaired (in this respect, see also clause 9.1. below).
    The Customer may only set off against claims of Vibranium if the Customer's particular claims are uncontested or confirmed in a final and binding judgment and only insofar as its counterclaims are based on the same legal relationship between the parties.

10. Customer's duties

    Proper use of the Software requires receipt of a Software Key from Vibranium or one of its authorized Resellers and Customer's installation of all Updates/Upgrades for the respective Software by Customer. If the Customer has not installed the current Updates/Upgrades of Vibranium, the Software's protection against computer viruses and other Malware may be materially impaired. Installation of the Software and its Updates/Upgrades as well as regular downloading of the full and current Updates/Upgrades shall be the Customer's sole responsibility.
    The Customer shall familiarize itself with the key functions of the Software or Service. The Customer shall bear the entire risk as to whether the Software or Service meets the individual requirements and needs of the Customer. The setup of a functional hardware and software environment for the Software or Service shall be the sole responsibility of the Customer. The same shall apply to regular data backup within the Customer's EDP system.
    The Customer shall comply with Vibranium advice and instructions concerning installation of the Software, the updating thereof by Updates/Upgrades and its operation. The Customer shall regularly consult Vibranium website (www.Vibranium.com) to learn Vibranium current advice and shall take this into account while operating the Software.
    The Customer shall install the Software at its own cost. This shall also be the case if certain Updates/Upgrades and releases require a new installation of the Software during the License Term.
    The Customer shall promptly notify Vibranium of any alleged or potential defects in the Products and/or Services provided.
    The Customer shall notify Vibranium without undue delay of any changes to its email address or contact information in order for Vibranium to be able to send the Customer security-relevant information for the use of the Software or Services.

11. Warranty and Limitations

    Unless expressly agreed otherwise, the Products provided by Vibranium as well as Vibranium Services shall reasonably conform to all material product information and specifications provided by Vibranium, including that in the user handbooks. Vibranium does not warrant that the Products and Services under the agreement will be fit for any particular purpose.
    The Customer is advised and understands that, based on the current state of the art, technology program errors cannot be excluded from a Software Product or Service with complete certainty and that it is not possible to develop Software or Services that detect any and all existing viruses or other Malware.
    FAILURE TO INSTALL UPDATES OR UPGRADES AS PROVIDED WILL VOID ANY WARRANTIES HEREUNDER.
    Customer agrees and warrants that the Products shall not be used in high risk pursuits that require error-free, permanent operation of systems and in which the failure of the Products may result in harm to an individuals life, body or health or in substantial damage to property or the environment (such as high risk activities and high availability activities, including but not limited to the operation of nuclear facilities, weapon systems, aviation navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, life support systems and equipment, machine and production processes of pharmaceuticals and food production). Vibranium does not warrant or guarantee that the Products are fit for use in these, or other, high risk areas.
    If the Customer is an Entrepreneur and Vibranium has provided the Customer with the Product pursuant to a perpetual, fully paid license, then defects in the provided Products, shall be rectified by Vibranium, as follows, provided the Customer has notified Vibranium of the respective defect promptly
    Notified errors shall be rectified by Vibranium choice through correction of the error ("repair") or provision of an error-free Product ("substitute delivery"). Costs for correction shall be borne by Vibranium.
    If the defects cannot be corrected within a reasonable period or if repair and substitute delivery fail for other reasons, then the Customer may, at its choice, reduce the Fee paid to Vibranium pro rata or - if the defects are not immaterial - terminate the agreement.
    Any damage claims of a Customer or claims for expenses incurred that arise from such defects shall be governed exclusively by clause 11.
    If Vibranium has provided a Customer with the Product pursuant to a fully paid license for a specific term, for one year after commencement of the License Term defects in the Product shall be rectified by Vibranium within a reasonable period after notification of the defect. The rectification of defects shall be effected, at Vibranium choice, by way of repair or substitute delivery, free of charge. The Customer is only entitled to terminate the agreement due to the failure to grant use in accordance with the agreement if Vibranium has been given sufficient opportunity to rectify the defect and such attempt has failed.
    A repair or substitute delivery shall be viewed to have failed only if Vibranium has been given sufficient opportunity to affect a repair or substitution without achieving the desired result or if the repair or substitution was unjustifiably refused by Vibranium. If rectification of a defect in the form of repair or subsequent delivery is only possible for Vibranium at unreasonable expenses, Vibranium may refuse to rectify the defect and may afford the Customer to its right to rescind or terminate the agreement.
    No warranty is provided for Vibranium Freeware or other Products and/or Services provided by Vibranium free of charge, except for the operability of the Computer Program hereinafter. The same shall apply for Vibranium Shareware, as long as there is no agreement with the Customer for the unconditional provision of a Software Key or Login against payment.
    In no event shall any Customer ever be entitled to access, or demand access to the source code for the Software and/or Managed Services.
    The Customer shall notify Vibranium without undue delay if a third party asserts claims against the Customer based on infringement of intellectual property rights by the Product and/or Managed Services. Should there be any such notification, whether in written documents or correspondence or in other form, the Customer shall provide these to Vibranium without undue delay. Vibranium liability for Customer losses due to such infringement is limited to the cost of the software or services provided by Vibranium.
    If the Customer is an Entrepreneur and the product of Vibranium is the subject of a perpetual license, the Customer's warranty claims for defects of the product lapse after one year from the commencement of the License Term.

12. Limitation of Liability for damages

Notwithstanding the legal nature of the claim, the following shall apply to a Customer's damage claims and/or claims for expenses incurred:

    Aside from clause 10.8 above, Vibranium shall only be liable for any of the Customer's damages resulting from grossly negligent or intentional behavior of Vibranium, and shall be limited to any amounts paid to Vibranium by Customer during the twelve months immediately preceding the Customer's claim.
    If the Products or Services are provided by Vibranium for a limited period of time, Vibranium liability for defects expire at the time of the termination of the agreement.
    The foregoing limitations of liability also apply to all Vibranium representatives, including but not limited to its directors, legal representatives, employees and other vicarious agents.

13. Retention of title, transfer by way of security

Should a Product of Vibranium be provided to the Customer pursuant to a license which, when fully paid, is to be perpetual, the following shall apply:

    Vibranium shall retain title in such Product(s) and goods as parts of Services until full payment. Should the Customer fail to pay, then Vibranium may demand return of the Product(s). The Terms providing that the Customer acquires no title, including but not limited to the title stipulated in clause 4. above, shall remain unaffected by this clause.
    Should the Customer sell the Products and Services provided by Vibranium before the Customer has itself paid the Fee to Vibranium, the Customer and Vibranium agree that the receivables from the resale shall be assigned to Vibranium. Should the Products and Services be provided together with other items, the assignment of the receivables shall be limited to the value of Vibranium Products and Services. Vibranium may disclose the assignment or demand that the Customer notifies the debtor of such assignment. The Customer shall formally assign the receivables if still necessary at any time at Vibranium request.
    Demand for return of Product by Vibranium shall not constitute grounds for rescission or termination of the agreement unless Vibranium expressly advises the Customer thereof.
    The Customer's license to use the Products and Services shall lapse upon demand for the return of the Product by Vibranium. Any and all backup copies made by the Customer for its own use must be returned to Vibranium or deleted by the Customer.

14. Miscellaneous

    These Terms and all disputes arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed exclusively by the laws in force in India. All actions under this Agreement shall be brought in the court of law of Pune, Maharashtra and you consent to the venue and the exclusive jurisdiction in its courts.
